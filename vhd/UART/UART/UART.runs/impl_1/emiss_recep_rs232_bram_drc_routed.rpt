CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/next_round_Counter_s_reg[4]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/next_round_Counter_s_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/next_round_Counter_s_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 PRESENT_MODULE/M_M/ram_reg has an input control pin PRESENT_MODULE/M_M/ram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: PRESENT_MODULE/M_M/ADDRBWRADDR[4]) which is driven by a register (PRESENT_MODULE/F_P/round_Counter_s_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
